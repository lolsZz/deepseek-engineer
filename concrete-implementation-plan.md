- [ ] Add plugin configuration system

```python
# Example plugin system structure
src/deepseek_engineer/mcp/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── base.py          # Base plugin class
  ├── loader.py        # Plugin discovery and loading
  ├── registry.py      # Plugin registration
  ├── lifecycle.py     # Plugin lifecycle management
  └── config.py        # Plugin configuration
```

#### 1.2 Sandbox Environment
- [ ] Implement process isolation
- [ ] Add resource limiting
- [ ] Create security boundaries
- [ ] Add plugin validation

#### 1.3 Plugin Management CLI
- [ ] Add plugin installation commands
- [ ] Create plugin listing functionality
- [ ] Implement plugin updates
- [ ] Add plugin removal

### 2. Performance Benchmarks

#### 2.1 Benchmark Framework
- [ ] Create benchmark runner
- [ ] Add timing measurements
- [ ] Implement resource usage tracking
- [ ] Add performance regression tests

#### 2.2 Benchmark Scenarios
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] File operation performance
- [ ] Memory usage patterns
- [ ] CPU utilization
- [ ] Concurrent request handling

#### 2.3 Reporting
- [ ] Create benchmark reports
- [ ] Add performance dashboards
- [ ] Implement trend analysis
- [ ] Add alert thresholds

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline

#### 3.1 GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
