## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up your environment variables
3. Install dependencies
4. Run the application

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Development Guide](development-guide.md).

## LLM Integration

DeepSeek Engineer provides comprehensive LLM integration through LiteLLM, supporting multiple providers while maintaining DeepSeek as the primary implementation. See [LiteLLM Integration](litellm-integration.md) for multi-provider support, [LLM Configuration](llm-configuration.md) for setup details, and [Advanced LLM Features](advanced-llm-features.md) for advanced capabilities.

## MCP Integration

DeepSeek Engineer implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for extending functionality through external tools and services. The implementation follows the [MCP Specification](mcp-specification.md) and provides comprehensive guides for [implementation](mcp-implementation.md) and [best practices](mcp-best-practices.md).

## Monitoring and Logging

The system includes comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities for debugging, analysis, and optimization. See [Logging and Monitoring](logging-and-monitoring.md) for detailed information about logging strategies, performance monitoring, and privacy considerations.
